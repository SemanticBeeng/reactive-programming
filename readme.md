# Principles of Reactive Programming
The examples for each week and some try-outs..

# Week 1
I get my information from a whole lot of resources, I will share it here:

# Documentation
- The [Scala Source Code on GitHub](https://github.com/scala/scala)
- The [Scala API Docs for 2.11.6](http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/api/2.11.6/#package)
- What does [invariant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_%28mathematics%29) mean?

# Video resources
